Dear Elias:

Per our phone conversation today, I am sending you the four test files that
I have used to test the ASD program.  These are zipped together.  The files
are listed below with the corresponding number of Lam-Aleph error
occurrences.

Avray.txt		(one error)
Avray34.txt		(one error)
Avray56.txt		(three errors)
Avray78.txt		(one error)

Note that I have edited these files and used a star (*) to indicate the
line where the error was taking place to make easy for you to locate the
line where the error is occuring.  The errors are as follows:

Avray.txt	second Lam-Aleph in the line
Avray34.txt	second Lam-Aleph in the line
Avray56.txt	second Lam-Aleph in the line
		second Lam-Aleph in the line
		second Lam-Aleph in the line
Avray78.txt	second Lam-Aleph in the line

Please review the above files after you run them through the ASD program
and let me know what you think.

I will wait for your response.

Thanks,

Mike
